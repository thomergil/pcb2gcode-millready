# pcb2gcode-millready

![vimdiff](img/vimdiff.png)

A Python utility to modify G-code files generated by [pcb2gcode](https://github.com/pcb2gcode/pcb2gcode) to swap the initial XY/Z movements. 

**Note: This code and documentation were mostly generated with the assistance of AI (Claude).**

## Features

This tool **swaps the initial Z and X/Y moves**. It arranges the first plunge operation to ensure the tool moves to Z=0 (all the way up) and then to the XY starting position before plunging down, reducing the risk of damage to the drill bit and the jig.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository or download the script
git clone https://github.com/thomergil/pcb2gcode-millready
cd pcb2gcode-millready

# Make the script executable (Linux/macOS)
chmod +x pcb2gcode-millready
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
./pcb2gcode-millready input.ngc output.ngc
```

Where:

- `input.ngc` is your G-code file generated by pcb2gcode
- `output.ngc` is the path where the modified G-code will be saved

### Examples

Process a G-code file generated by `pcb2gcode`:

```bash
./pcb2gcode-millready trace.ngc trace_millready.ngc
```
